# Nishant Rana [A FRIENDLY ETHICAL HACKER]


About Me 

Welcome to my darkside a space which explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. At the age of five I had been very curious to discover what technology was being utilized, I had the drive to open any electronic device I laid my hands on using a set of tools which belonged to my grandmum. Together, with and the positive vibes and encouragment from my grandad I was happily discovering with understanding how those gadets worked. Eventually, It paid off as I had successuflly repaired a bedside clock and many others along the way and not to mention the unsucessfull ones which my mum was right I would not be able to reassemble it back. In the early 2000 laptops and mobile phones was my new curiosity. From physically opening these devices I moved to a newer and much lighter tool box. This was software which I used to download and try unlock other devices. I followed my passion and have secured my own tool box just the way my grandmum had!
