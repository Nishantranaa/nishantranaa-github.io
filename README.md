# Nishant Rana [A FRIENDLY ETHICAL HACKER]


About Me 

Welcome to my darkside a space which explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. At the age of five I had been very curious on experiencing technology with a driving passion to open any electronic device I laid my hands on! A set of tools belonging to my grandmum and the positive vibes and encouragment from my grandad I was happily discovering how gadets worked each day. Eventually It paid off as I had successuflly repaired a bedside clock. In the early 2000 laptops and mobile phones was my new curiosity. From physically opening these devices I moved to a newer and much lighter tool box.
