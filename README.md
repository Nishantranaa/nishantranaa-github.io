About Me 
Welcome to my darkside a space which explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I am a creative bloke that loves to figure out were and when an intrusion may occur! My secondary research focuses on the mind of a hacker. 

I believe that the only way to produce a better analyst of when an intrution is likely to happen is by being good at ethical hackering. This helps make security better by discovering the failures and working with vendors to make it better. By working with vendors, ethical hackers are also learning about new technologies and how they operate. This helps grow their skill set, allowing them to accomplish fame and notoriety amongst cybersecurity vendors and hackers alike.‚Äù
