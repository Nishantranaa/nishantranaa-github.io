About Me 

Welcome to my darkside a space which explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. At the age of five I was very curious of technology and keen on trying ways to open any electronic device which I had got my had on! With the encouragment of my granddad I was happily discovering how thinsgs work each day. I was proud of having successfuly repaired and modified a bedside clock for my grand dads friend. 

This curiosity contined to mobile devices and laptops. I was able to unlock my dads old ericson handphone using thrid party software in the early millenium.   

that loves to figure out were and when an intrusion may occur! My secondary research focuses on the mind of a hacker. 

I believe that the only way to produce a better analyst of when an intrution is likely to happen is by being good at ethical hackering. This helps make security better by discovering the failures and working with vendors to make it better.
