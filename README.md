* [A FRIENDLY ETHICAL HACKER]


About Me 

Welcome to my dark side. This space explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. At the age of five, I was curious and explored the inside of gadgets. I had the drive to open many electronic device I laid my hands on, previledged to be allowed to use a set of tools that belonged to my grandmother. Encouragement from my grandad helped me to continue happily discovering and understanding how those gadgets worked. It helped me to be creative and successful in repairing my gadget; a bedside clock. Of course, there was a number of unsuccessful ones which my mum was right yelling and worried that I would not be able to reassemble back. In the early 2000 laptops and mobile phones was my new curiosity. From physically opening these devices I moved to a newer and much lighter toolbox. This was software that I used to download and try to unlock other devices. I followed my passion and have secured my toolbox just the way my grandmum had!
