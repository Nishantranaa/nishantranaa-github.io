# Nishant Rana [A FRIENDLY ETHICAL HACKER]


About Me 

Welcome to my dark side. A space that explores my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. At the age of five, I had been very curious to discover what technology was being utilized, I had the drive to open any electronic device I laid my hands on using a set of tools that belonged to my grandmum. Together, with and the positive vibes and encouragement from my grandad I was happily discovering with understanding how those gadgets worked. Eventually, It paid off as I had successfully repaired a bedside clock and many others along the way and not to mention the unsuccessful ones which my mum was right I would not be able to reassemble back. In the early 2000 laptops and mobile phones was my new curiosity. From physically opening these devices I moved to a newer and much lighter toolbox. This was software that I used to download and try to unlock other devices. I followed my passion and have secured my toolbox just the way my grandmum had!
